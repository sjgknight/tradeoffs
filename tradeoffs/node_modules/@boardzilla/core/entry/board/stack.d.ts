 * A Stack hides all movement information within to avoid exposing the identity
 * of pieces inside the stack. Useful for decks of cards where calling
 * `shuffle()` should prevent players from knowing the order of the cards. By
 * default elements in a stack are hidden and are rendered as a stack with a
 * small offset and a limited number of items. Use configureLayout to change
 * this.
